# Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Analysis #

## Description ##
 - It is a machine learning project that predicts customer purchase intentions using UCI Online Shoppers dataset. Compares three algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM) with comprehensive feature engineering.

## Requirements ##
 - `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ucimlrepo`

## How to Run ##
 - In the terminal of Pycharm or any other python IDE, input `python online_shoppers_ml_project.py`

## What It Does ##
 - Loads UCI Online Shoppers dataset automatically
 - Expands 17 features to 50+ engineered features
 - Trains and evaluates 3 different ML algorithms
 - Generates performance comparison tables and visualizations
 - Runtime: approximately 10-15 minutes

## Output ##
 - The program displays algorithm performance metrics and creates several plots comparing model effectiveness. All results are automatically displayed each time they are generated, and then dismissed once the output page is manually closed .
